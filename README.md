## General Info

Creating a work day scheduler utilizing JQuery, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 

This exersize helped increase knowledge of Jquery and utilize many of the various functions. Also utilized Javascript in tandem to make the area work. 

There were several hurdles with creating the work day scheduler. Started with creating a variable object with all of the times 9am to 5pm and then utilizing a for loop to create all of the time elements. It took research to determine how to save the information to local storage and display it correctly. 
1. Scrubbed original idea because the local storage kept getting overwritten. 
2. Created a single item and it worked.
3. Tried combinations of if/else statements to get the correct color settings. 
4. Ended up using many, many, too many functions, but I got it to work utilizing a combination of Jquery and Javascript commands 
5. It was a challenging activity, but thrilled to have completed the page.

##### Future_scope
Future scope would be to add the ability to choose future dates and information on the scheduler. Some pop-up reminders of upcoming tasks would be useful to ensure items aren't missed. Adding a reload button, so that the past, present, future colors change automatically without the user having to refresh the page.
