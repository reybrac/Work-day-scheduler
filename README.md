## General Info

Creating a work day scheduler utilizing JQuery, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 

This exersize helped increase knowledge of Jquery and utilize many of the various functions. Also utilized Javascript in tandem to make the area work. 

There were several hurdles with creating the work day scheduler. Started with creating a variable object with all of the times 9am to 5pm and then utilizing a for loop to create all of the time elements. It took research to determine how to save the information to local storage and display it correctly. 
1. Scrubbed original idea because the local storage kept getting overwritten. 
2. Created a .
3. Tried sending information local storage, but only one value would save at a time. 
4. Ended up using a "for" loop and correctly setting/getting the information from the local storage to correctly show highscores. 
5. It was a challenging activity, but thrilled to have completed the page.
